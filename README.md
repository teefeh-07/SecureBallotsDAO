# SecureBallotsDAO

SecureBallotsDAO is a cutting-edge smart contract for secure and transparent voting. It's designed to work with the Stacks blockchain, offering a decentralized approach to decision-making.

## What's It All About?

This contract lets you:
- Create proposals
- Set up weighted voting
- Use a commit-reveal scheme for voting
- Keep votes anonymous

It's perfect for DAOs, online communities, or any group that needs secure voting.

## How to Use It

1. Deploy the contract to the Stacks blockchain.
2. The contract owner can create proposals and set voter weights.
3. Voters commit their votes using a hash.
4. Later, voters reveal their votes.
5. The contract tallies the votes, considering the weights.
